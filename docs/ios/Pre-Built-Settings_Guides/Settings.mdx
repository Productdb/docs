# Pre-built Settings screen

## Overview: How to use existing Settings screen.

We have to use a class [ProductDBSettingViewController](/ios/components/productdb-settings), which is used to select Audio device and Camera device
from the list of available devices.

<img
  src="/static/ios/ios_settings.jpg"
  alt="Example Image"
  width="200"
  height="100"
/>

### Launch prebuilt setting screen

```swift
private func launchSettingScreen() {
  let controller = ProductDBSettingViewController(nameTag: self.meeting.localUser.name,
                                             meeting: self.meeting,
                                             completion: {})
  controller.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
  self.present(controller, animated: true)
}
```

`completion` param is a clouser of type `(()->Void)? = nil`
