# Custom Grid View

## Introduction

The `GridView` class provided in ProductDB's iOS UIKit allows you to create custom grid views to display content
in a structured layout. This guide will walk you through the process of understanding, customizing, and
utilizing the `GridView` class to create your custom grid views.

## Step 1: Understanding the GridView Class

The `GridView` class is a customizable UIView subclass designed to display a grid of views. It provides properties
and methods to manage the arrangement and presentation of child views within the grid.

### Key Components:

- **Properties Needed to manage GridView**:

  - `maxItems`: Maximum number of items the grid can contain.
  - `currentVisibleItem`: Number of items currently visible in the grid.
  - `scrollView`: UIScrollView for enabling scrolling if the grid overflows.
  - `views`: Array holding the child views of the grid.

### Example Usage:

```swift
let tile = ProductDBParticipantTileView(mobileClient: meeting,
                                    participant: participant,
                                    isForLocalUser: false,
                                    showScreenShareVideoView: false)
```

These tiles stored in `views` array can be rendered in `scrollView` and `currentVisibleItem`, `maxItems` can
manage state of grid to show/hide certain tiles if pagination is needed.

Remove tile from view using `tileView?.removeFromSuperview()`

## Integrating Participant Tile Views

To display video views within the `GridView`, you can utilize the `ProductDBParticipantTileContainerView` and
`ProductDBParticipantTileView` classes provided by ProductDB's iOS UIKit. These classes encapsulate the logic for
rendering video streams of meeting participants.

### `ProductDBParticipantTileContainerView`

The `ProductDBParticipantTileContainerView` is a UIView subclass designed to contain a single `ProductDBParticipantTileView`.
It provides methods for preparing the view for reuse and setting the participant whose video stream should be displayed.

#### Example Usage:

```swift
let tileContainerView = ProductDBParticipantTileContainerView()
tileContainerView.setParticipant(meeting: myMeetingClient,
                             participant: meetingParticipant)
```

### ProductDBParticipantTileView

The [ProductDBParticipantTileView](/ios/components/ProductDB-participant-tile-view) class represents a single tile
within the grid view, displaying the video stream of a meeting participant.
It manages the layout and presentation of the participant's video view, along with
additional features such as participant name tags and pin indicators.

You can add instances of ProductDBParticipantTileView to the GridView to render multiple video streams within the grid,
providing a comprehensive view of meeting participants during video conferences.
