# Receiving chat messages

To be able to receive chat messages you need to implement a method
`onChatUpdates()` method from callback `ProductDBChatEventsListener`. You can
subscribe to this events by calling
`meeting.addChatEventsListener(dyteChatEventsListener)`

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: ProductDBChatEventsListener {
  func onChatUpdates(messages: [ProductDBChatMessage]) {
  // to load chat messages
  }

  func onNewChatMessage(message: ProductDBChatMessage) {
    // when a new chat message is shared in the meeting
  }
}
```

The `onChatUpdates()` method will be called whenever there is a change in the chat messages. The `messages` parameter is a list of `ProductDBChatMessage` objects that have been sent in the chat.

The `onNewChatMessage()` method will be called whenever a new chat message is shared in the meeting. The `message` parameter is a `ProductDBChatMessage` object that has been sent in the chat.
