# Introduction

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `meeting.polls`. It provides
methods to create polls, vote, and more.

`meeting.polls.polls` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where
each element is an object of type `ProductDBPollMessage`.

```swift
class ProductDBPollMessage{
  let id: String
  let question: String
  let anonymous: Bool
  let hideVotes: Bool
  let createdBy: String
  let options: [ProductDBPollOption]
}
```

The type `ProductDBPollMessage` is the main class for any poll in ProductDB. It also
contains list of `ProductDBPollOption` which are options for a given poll. And every
`ProductDBPollOption` has list of votes inside of it. Votes are objects of class
`ProductDBPollVote` which internally has id and name of the vote.

```swift
class ProductDBPollOption{
  let text: String
  let votes: [ProductDBPollVote]
  let count: Int
}

class ProductDBPollVote{
  let id: String
  let name: String
}
```

One can easily create, vote and view polls by listening to callbacks on
`meeting` object.

## Listening to new polls in a meeting

To be able to receive new poll messages you need to implement a method
`onPollUpdates()` method from callback `ProductDBMeetingRoomEventsListener`. You can
subscribe to this events by calling
`meeting.addMeetingEventsListener(meetingViewModel)`

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: ProductDBMeetingRoomEventsListener {
  func onNewPoll(poll: ProductDBPollMessage) {
    // code to handle new poll
  }

  func onPollUpdates(pollMessages: [ProductDBPollMessage]) {
    // code to handle polls and their vote updates.
  }
}
```
