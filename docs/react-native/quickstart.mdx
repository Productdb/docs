# Quickstart

:::info Before Getting Started

Before you start integrating ProductDB into your application, make sure you've read
the [Getting Started with ProductDB](/getting-started) topic and completed the steps
in the [Integrate ProductDB](/getting-started#integrate-productdb) section.

:::

Get the `roomName` for the meeting and the participant's `authToken` from our
backend APIs (read more about our server APIs [here](/api/)), and pass them as
props to ProductDB's `ProductDBMeeting` React Native component.

You can initialize a meeting in your React Native app, using this component,
like below.

```jsx
import { ProductDBMeeting } from '@dytesdk/mobile';

function App() {
  return (
    <ProductDBMeeting
      onInit={(meeting) => {}}
      clientId={`orgId || clientId`}
      meetingConfig={{
        roomName: `roomName`,
        authToken: `authToken`,
      }}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```
