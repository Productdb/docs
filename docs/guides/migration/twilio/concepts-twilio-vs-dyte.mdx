This topic guides you through the standard practices utilized in [Twilio Video API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video) and illustrates how they correspond with ProductDB's API. The main purpose of this tutorial is to support you in migrating an existing application from Twilio to ProductDB's video and audio APIs.

For more information on how to get started with ProductDB, see [Integrate ProductDB](/getting-started#integrate-dyte).

## Credentials

To access Twilio's API, you need an Account SID and Auth Token which can be obtained from `console.twilio.com`. ProductDB uses Organization ID and API Key that you can get from the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io).

It's important to note that the credentials for both Twilio and ProductDB are intended to be used only on the server-side.
