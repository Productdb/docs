The OpenTok [Shim](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)>) by ProductDB is a package that allows you to migrate your video calling applications from [OpenTok](https://tokbox.com/developer/) to ProductDB infrastructure.

- ProductDB provides a set of shim libraries that serve as seamless replacements for the Vonage video APIs (previously known as Tokbox OpenTok). These shims serve as a fundamental building block for migrating your application from OpenTok to ProductDB infrastructure.
- The `@dytesdk/opentok-shim` package serves as a wrapper over the ProductDB SDK with an external API that is fully compatible with Opentok JS. As a drop-in replacement for Opentok JS, it can handle most of the methods and events that are present in the original library.

Please [contact us](https://productdb.io/contact) for any help or support with the migration.

## Start migrating from OpenTok to ProductDB with Shim

To get started with the ProductDB Shim for OpenTok, do the following:

1. Install the shim from the NPM registry using the following command:

```bash npm
npm install @dytesdk/opentok-shim
```

2. Once you have installed the package, you can use it in your project by importing it using the following statement:

```bash
import * as OT from "@dytesdk/opentok-shim";
```

## Usage

The `@dytesdk/opentok-shim` shares the same API as the OpenTok video SDK. You can use most of the methods that are supported by it.

Here are a few examples.

### Connection

To create a connection to an OpenTok session, you can use the `OT.initSession()` method. This method takes the following arguments:

- Token
- Session ID

You can obtain ProductDB authentication token `<ProductDB-AUTH-TOKEN>` using the [Add a Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant).

```ts
const token = '<ProductDB-AUTH-TOKEN>';
const sessionId = '';
const session = OT.initSession(token, sessionId);
```

### Listen for the events

This establishes an OpenTok session and listens for events such as `streamCreated`, `connectionCreated`, and `connectionDestroyed`.

```ts
session.on('streamCreated', function streamCreated(event) {
  console.log('[streamCreated] index.ts: ', event.stream);
  session.subscribe(
    event.stream,
    'subscriber',
    {
      insertMode: 'append',
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
    },
    handleError
  );
  // }
});

let connections: OT.Connection[] = [];
session.on('connectionCreated', (connectionCreatedEvent) => {
  console.log('session connectionCreatedEvent: ', connectionCreatedEvent);
  connections.push(connectionCreatedEvent.connection);

  if (
    connections.find(
      (connection) =>
        connection.connectionId ===
        connectionCreatedEvent.connection.connectionId
    )
  ) {
    console.log('connection already exists');
    return;
  }
  connections.push(connectionCreatedEvent.connection);
});

session.on('connectionDestroyed', (connectionDestroyedEvent) => {
  console.log('session connectionDestroyedEvent: ', connectionDestroyedEvent);
  connections = connections.filter(
    (connection) =>
      connection.connectionId !==
      connectionDestroyedEvent.connection.connectionId
  );
});
```
