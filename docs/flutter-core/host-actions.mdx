# Host Actions & Permissions

Based on your peer preset permissions you can perform certain host actions in ProductDB's Flutter SDK. As you follow through this page, you'll know what the host actions are and how to implement it based on permissions.

## Permissions

Permissions are set in the Developer Portal. Based on the permissions set, you can perform certain host actions. To access permissions, use `ProductDBClient.permissions` method. The permissions are as follows:

### Media Permissions

Media permissions (audio, video and screenshare) can be accessed using `ProductDBClient.permissions.media`. You can get audio, video and screenshare permissions. Audio and screenshare permissions are of `ProductDBMediaPermission` type & video permissions are of `ProductDBVideoPermissions` type.

`ProductDBMediaPermission` is a enum & can have 3 values:

- `ProductDBMediaPermission.allowed` : If the user is allowed to access the media.
- `ProductDBMediaPermission.canRequest` : If the user can request access to the media. Ex: If a user is off stage but can request to come on stage in case of webinar.
- `ProductDBMediaPermission.notAllowed` : If the user is not allowed to access the media.

`ProductDBVideoPermissions` have 3 properties:

- `permission`: It is of `ProductDBMediaPermission` type & stores the video permission.
- `frameRate` : It is of type `int` & stores the frame rate of the video.
- `quality` : It is of type `string` and stores the quality of the video.

```dart

// To get audio permission
final ProductDBMediaPermission audioPermission = ProductDBClient.permissions.media.audio;

// To get video details
final ProductDBVideoPermissions videoPermission = ProductDBClient.permissions.media.video;

// To get screenshare permission
final ProductDBMediaPermission screensharePermission = ProductDBClient.permissions.media.screenshare;
```

### Waiting Room Permissions

Waiting room permissions are of type `WaitingRoomPermissions` contains 2 properties:

- `canAcceptRequests`: It is of type `bool` & tells if the user can accept/reject waiting requests of participants present in waiting room.
- `type`: It is of enum type `WaitingRoomType` and is useful to know where client can directly enter meeting room or need permission from host.

`WaitingRoomType` can have 4 values:

- `WaitingRoomType.skip` : If the user can directly enter the meeting room.
- `WaitingRoomType.onAccept` : If the user needs permission from host to enter the meeting room.
- `WaitingRoomType.skipOnAccept` : If the user needs permission from host just the first time while trying to join meeting room.
- `WaitingRoomType.skipOnPriviligedUserEntry` : If the user can enter once there's a privileged user is present in the room.

```dart
final WaitingRoomPermissions waitingRoomPermissions = ProductDBClient.permissions.waitingRoom;
```

### Chat Permissions

Chat permissions are of type `ChatPermissions` contains 2 properties:

- `canSendText`: It is of type `bool` & tells if the user can send messages in the chat.
- `canSendFiles`: It is of type `bool` & tells if the user can send images/files in the chat.

```dart
final ChatPermissions chatPermissions = ProductDBClient.permissions.chat;
```

- `canPinParticipant`: It is of type `bool` & tells if the user can pin other participants in the room.
- `canTriggerRecording`: It is of type `bool` & tells if the user can trigger recording in the room.

```dart
final HostPermissions hostPermissions = ProductDBClient.permissions.host;
```

### Poll Permissions

- `canCreate`: It is of type `bool` & tells if the user can create polls in the meeting room.
- `canVote`: It is of type `bool` & tells if the user can vote in the polls.

## Host Actions

A peer can execute following actions if their preset allows it. To access preset permissions, see the permissions section [above](#permissions):

### Pin/Unpin participant

You can pin & unpin a participant in a meeting room. Use `pinParticipant(participant)` and `unpinParticipant()` method to pin & unpin the `participant` respectively. The `participant` is of `ProductDBMeetingParticipant`type.

```dart

// Pin the `participant`
ProductDBClient.hostActions.pinParticipant(participant);

// Unpin pinned participant
ProductDBClient.hostActions.unpinParticipant();
```

### Kick participant(s)

You can kick a participant or kick all participants from a meeting using `kickParticipant(participant)` and `kickAll()` method respectively. The `participant` is of `ProductDBMeetingParticipant` type.

```dart

// Kick the `participant`
ProductDBClient.hostActions.kickParticipant(participant);

// Kick all participants
ProductDBClient.hostActions.kickAll();
```

### Accept/Reject waitlisted request

You can accept or reject a waitlisted request using `acceptWaitlistedParticipant(participant)` and `rejectWaitlistedParticipant(participant)` method respectively. The `participant` is of `ProductDBMeetingParticipant` type.

```dart

// Accept the waitlisted `waitlistedParticipant`
ProductDBClient.hostActions.acceptWaitlistedParticipant(waitlistedParticipant);

// Reject the waitlisted `waitlistedParticipant`
ProductDBClient.hostActions.rejectWaitlistedParticipant(waitlistedParticipant);
```

### Mute participant(s) audio

You can mute a participant's audio or mute all participants' audio using `disableParticipantAudio(participant)` and `muteAllAudios()` method respectively. The `participant` is of `ProductDBMeetingParticipant` type.

```dart

// Mute the `participant` audio
ProductDBClient.hostActions.disableParticipantAudio(participant);

// Mute all participants' audio
ProductDBClient.hostActions.muteAllAudios();

```

### Disable participant(s) video

You can disable a participant's video or disable all participants' video using `disableParticipantVideo(participant)` and `disableAllVideos()` method respectively. The `participant` is of `ProductDBMeetingParticipant` type.

```dart

// Disable the `participant` video
ProductDBClient.hostActions.disableParticipantVideo(participant);

// Disable all participants' video
ProductDBClient.hostActions.disableAllVideos();
```
