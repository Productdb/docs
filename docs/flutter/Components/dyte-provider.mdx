# ProductDBProvider

A foundational widget designed to initialize and provide the necessary ProductDB environment for a Flutter application. The `ProductDBProvider` acts as a context wrapper that sets up design tokens, client configurations, and UI Kit information required for ProductDB components. It ensures that ProductDB functionalities are available and properly initialized throughout the widget tree where it's used.

## Usage

To use `ProductDBProvider`, wrap the root of your application:

```dart
ProductDBProvider(
  client: ProductDBMobileClientInstance,
  uiKitInfo: ProductDBUIKitInfoInstance,
  child: MaterialApp(
    // Your app's home screen or an entry widget
    home: YourAppHome(),
  ),
)
```

if you don't want to wrap the root of your app inside `ProductDBProvider`, you can also wrap a specific part of your app where you want to use ProductDB components but after adding `ProductDBProvider` you need a `MaterialApp` widget under it.


This approach ensures that all the necessary ProductDB setup is done before your app UI starts, allowing you to utilize ProductDB features seamlessly within your application.

## Properties

- `child`: (**Required**) The widget below this widget in the tree. This is usually your MaterialApp or your application's home widget.
- `client`: (**Required**) An instance of `ProductDBMobileClient`. This represents the ProductDB client configuration that includes authentication and other essential settings.
- `uiKitInfo`: (**Required**) An instance of `ProductDBUIKitInfo`. This holds information related to the ProductDB UI Kit such as design tokens and other UI configurations.

## Notes

Ensure that the `ProductDBMobileClient` and `ProductDBUIKitInfo` are properly configured before passing them to the `ProductDBProvider`. This is crucial for the proper functioning of all ProductDB-related components within your application.

## Example

Here is an example of using `ProductDBProvider` in an application:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ProductDBProvider(
      client: ProductDBMobileClient(
        // ProductDB client configuration
      ),
      uiKitInfo: ProductDBUIKitInfo(
        // UI Kit information and design tokens
      ),
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

By wrapping your app with `ProductDBProvider`, you ensure that all necessary ProductDB setups are initialized and available for your app components, allowing you to build a fully functional ProductDB-enabled application.
