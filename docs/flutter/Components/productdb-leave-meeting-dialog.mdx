# ProductDBLeaveMeetingDialog

A dialog widget designed for confirming the action of leaving a ProductDB meeting. This widget is part of the ProductDB UI Kit and is intended to provide a clear and concise user interface for confirming the exit process from a meeting environment.

## Usage

Here is how you can use the `ProductDBLeaveMeetingDialog` in your Flutter application:

```dart
ProductDBLeaveMeetingDialog(
  dyteMobileClient: yourProductDBMobileClientInstance,
)
```

## Properties

- `dyteMobileClient`: (**Required**) An instance of `ProductDBMobileClient` used to perform actions like leaving the meeting room or ending the meeting for all participants.
- `designToken`: (Optional) An instance of `ProductDBDesignTokens` for customizing the appearance according to the ProductDB Design System. If not specified, the widget will default to the global design tokens.

## Design Token

The `ProductDBLeaveMeetingDialog` utilizes `ProductDBDesignTokens` for theming:

- `borderRadius`: The border radius of the dialog box, which defaults to a value defined in the design tokens.
- `fillColor`: The background color of the dialog, typically set to provide a neutral or alerting backdrop for the content.
- `textColor`: The color of the text within the dialog, ensuring it is readable against the `fillColor`.

## Features

- **Confirmation Prompt**: Provides a clear prompt asking the user if they are sure they want to leave the meeting.
- **Action Buttons**: Includes "Cancel" and "Leave" buttons, allowing the user to either cancel the action or confirm their intent to leave the meeting.
- **Host Controls**: If the user has host permissions, an additional button "End meeting for all" is displayed, providing the option to end the meeting for all participants.
