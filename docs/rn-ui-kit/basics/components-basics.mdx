# Components Basics

Let's look at the structure of individual components and how to use them when
building your own UI.

There are two important things to understand about ProductDB UI Components

## 1. They work with very tightly with our core SDK

Our UI component are tightly coupled with classes from our core SDK, they will
automatically update when the underlying property changes

### Participant components

These are components which take a single participant object as prop

`meeting.self` and participant objects from `meeting.participants` maps can be
passed as a participant to this prop.

```jsx
function Example() {
  const { meeting } = useProductDBMeeting();

  return (
    <View
      style={{ flex: 1, flexDirection: 'row', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '12px' }}
    >
      <ProductDBNameTag participant={meeting.self} />
      {/* You should also pass the `meeting` object to see the `(you)` text */}
      <ProductDBNameTag participant={meeting.self} meeting={meeting} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Meeting components

Similar to participant components, there are components that take the entire
meeting object

```jsx
function Example() {
  const { meeting } = useProductDBMeeting();

  return (
    <View
      style={{ flex: 1, flexDirection: 'row', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '12px' }}
    >
      <ProductDBChat meeting={meeting} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

The above code will render the Chat UI, updates when there is a new message and
allow you to send a new message.

## 2. State Management

While meeting state is stored in core SDK's classes, there are also some pure UI
states that might change during a meeting. For example, when user clicks the
leave meeting button, there is a confirmation popup on the screen, this state
reflects only a UI state.

To listen and manipulate these states some components will accept a `states`
props.

```jsx
<ProductDBDialogManager
  states={{
    activeLeaveConfirmation: true,
  }}
/>
```

## 3. Component Specific Props

Each component can have their own set of props

Here are some examples on `ProductDBButton` component:

### Button variants

```jsx
<Row style={{ flex: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '8px' }}>
  <ProductDBButton>Primary button</ProductDBButton>
  <ProductDBButton variant="secondary">Secondary button</ProductDBButton>
  <ProductDBButton variant="danger">Danger button</ProductDBButton>
  <ProductDBButton variant="ghost">Ghost button</ProductDBButton>
</Row>
```
