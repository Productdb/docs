<ProductDBNotifications
  meeting={meeting}
  config={{
    config: {
      notifications: {
        participant_left: false,
      },
      notification_sounds: {
        participant_left: false,
      },
      participant_joined_sound_notification_limit: 10,
      participant_chat_message_sound_notification_limit: 10,
