# Introduction

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `meeting.polls`. It provides
methods to create polls, vote, and more.

`meeting.polls.polls` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where
each element is an object of type `ProductDBPollMessage`.

```kotlin
data class ProductDBPollMessage(
  val id: String,
  val question: String,
  val anonymous: Boolean,
  val hideVotes: Boolean,
  val createdBy: String,
  val options: List<ProductDBPollOption>,
)
```

The type `ProductDBPollMessage` represents a poll in a ProductDB meeting. It also
contains list of `ProductDBPollOption` which are options for a given poll. And every
`ProductDBPollOption` has list of votes inside of it. Votes are objects of class
`ProductDBPollVote` which internally has id and name of the vote.

```kotlin
data class ProductDBPollOption(
  val text: String,
  val votes: List<ProductDBPollVote>,
  val count: Int
)

data class ProductDBPollVote(
  val id: String,
  val name: String
)
```

One can easily create, vote and view polls by listening to callbacks on
`meeting` object.

## Listening to new polls in a meeting

To be able to receive new poll messages you need to implement a method
`onPollUpdates()` method from callback `ProductDBMeetingRoomEventsListener`. You can
subscribe to this events by calling
`meeting.addMeetingEventsListener(ProductDBMeetingRoomEventsListener)`

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object :
  ProductDBMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onNewPoll(poll: ProductDBPollMessage) {
      // code to handle new poll
    }

    override fun onPollUpdates(pollMessages: List<ProductDBPollMessage>) {
      // code to handle polls and their vote updates.
    }
  })
```
