# ProductDBRecordingToggle

A button which toggles recording state of a meeting.

Only a privileged user can perform this action,
thus the button will not be visible for participants
who don't have the permission to record a meeting.

Note that the toggle button won't be rendered if you do not have the
necessary permission.

```jsx live
<Center>
  <ProductDBRecordingToggle size="sm" meeting={meeting} />
  <ProductDBRecordingToggle size="lg" meeting={meeting} />
  <ProductDBRecordingToggle variant="horizontal" size="sm" meeting={meeting} />
</Center>
```
