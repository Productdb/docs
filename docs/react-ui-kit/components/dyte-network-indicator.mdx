# ProductDBNetworkIndicator

A component that indicates poor network connection.

```jsx
<ProductDBNetworkIndicator meeting={meeting} participant={meeting.self} />
```

It listens to the mediaScoreUpdate event of the passed participant to get the score.

```tsx
 (participant as ProductDBParticipant).addListener('mediaScoreUpdate', ({ kind, isScreenshare, score }) => {
  console.log(`Score for ${isScreenshare ? 'screen share': ''} ${kind} was:: ${score}`);
});
```

:::note info

This component will only be visible if the network quality is poor (less than or equal to 3, on a scale of 5, 5 being best).
